Smarter CSS With SASS
================================================================

Sass is a compiler of CSS, has been around since 2007, adds useful programming constructs to CSS and is becoming a standard for authoring stylesheets. Sass enhancements make CSS more versatile by eliminating duplication of common style patterns, allowing style logic to be reused and thus making your stylesheets easier to maintain.

In this session you will earn practical Sass tips and best practices for making your projects easier to build and simpler to maintain. The session will cover Sass basics, how to leverage the power of Sass mixins for cleaner code, tips on how to use Sass for responsive grid layouts by using Sass functions and media queries, how to use Sass alongside Compass efficiently and lastly review a few boilerplate examples with suggestions on how to structure your assets files.
